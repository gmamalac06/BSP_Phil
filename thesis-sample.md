    CHAPTER 1
    Introduction
    In today's fast-evolving technological landscape, the transportation sector is continually seeking innovations that enhance service efficiency and user convenience. In Cotabato City, the habal-habal transportation system—though a vital means of mobility for many residents—faces challenges such as inefficient route management, delayed dispatch, and limited real-time communication between drivers and passengers. The existing system operates through informal networks and manual coordination, resulting in prolonged waiting times, inconsistent pricing, and suboptimal service delivery. 
    Drivers typically position themselves at established waiting points throughout the city, while commuters must physically locate available drivers and engage in direct price negotiation before each journey. This traditional approach lacks standardization in booking mechanisms, driver verification, and service quality monitoring, creating significant inefficiencies in the transportation ecosystem. This capstone project proposes a Web-based Solution for Efficient Habal-habal Transportation Management in Cotabato City aimed at streamlining operations, thereby improving efficiency and service reliability.
                The implementation of a web-based solution for Habal-Habal transportation management in Cotabato City presents a practical and innovative approach to improving local mobility. By digitizing and organizing the operations of Habal-Habal services, the system addresses key challenges such as lack of coordination, inconsistent fare pricing, and limited accessibility. This solution not only enhances the efficiency and safety of both drivers and passengers but also promotes accountability and transparency within the informal transport sector. As Cotabato City continues to grow, integrating technology into traditional transportation systems becomes essential for sustainable urban development. This project lays the groundwork for future enhancements, including mobile application integration, GPS tracking, and data analytics, all of which can further support a smarter, more connected transportation network.
     
    1.1	Background of the Study
    Recent advancements in web technologies and mobile communications have paved the way for smarter transportation systems worldwide. In many urban areas, integrated web-based platforms have successfully addressed issues related to traffic congestion, scheduling, and route optimization. However, in Cotabato City, the traditional habal-habal system largely relies on informal networks and manual coordination, which often results in miscommunication, prolonged waiting times, and inefficiencies in service delivery.
    The current landscape is marked by a rising demand for efficient transportation solutions that cater to the dynamic needs of the city's residents. Although various sectors have adopted digital solutions to optimize operations, the habal-habal sector has yet to fully leverage these advancements. The Web-based Solution for Efficient Habal-habal Transportation Management in Cotabato City explores how a comprehensive web platform can be tailored to the unique operational context of Cotabato City's habal-habal services, providing a system that integrates real-time data, route management, and effective communication channels. By implementing modern technologies such as React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase, this research aims to transform the conventional habal-habal system into a digitally enhanced transportation network that benefits both service providers and commuters.
